  This project demonstrates my understanding of the Vanilla Stack — HTML, CSS, and
  JavaScript without relying on external frameworks or libraries. It is a fully
  functional task management web application that allows users to:
</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Add new tasks</li>
    <li>View and filter tasks by status (pending or completed)</li>
    <li>Edit and delete tasks dynamically</li>
    <li>Mark tasks as completed for progress tracking.</li>
    <li>Reorganize tasks using intuitive drag‑and‑drop functionality</li>
    <li>Persist data by saving tasks to local storage</li>
  </ul>
<p>
  Through this project, I focused on building a clean, accessible, and interactive
  user experience while reinforcing core web development principles.
